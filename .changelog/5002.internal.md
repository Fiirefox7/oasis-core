go/p2p: Improve peer manager's peer handling

Peer manager currently connects to all nodes in the registry which has
multiple drawbacks (connections get pruned, no protocol selection, no peer
discovery). This should be changed so that peers are connected depending
on the supported protocols and the number of peers in a protocol/topic
should be regulated in a controlled fashion.
