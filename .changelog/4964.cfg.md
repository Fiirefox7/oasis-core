go/consensus/tendermint: Refactor seed node and peer addresses

Until now a seed node was a Tendermint backend-specific construct which
supported only one service. To provide support for other services we had
to refactor the seed node and generalize peer addresses. This led to the
following configuration changes.

Seed nodes:

- Tendermint seed mode setting `consensus.tendermint.mode:seed` was removed
  and replaced with `mode:seed`. Full and archive modes remained intact and
  can still be used in non-seed node configurations.

Non-seed nodes:

- Setting `consensus.tendermint.seed` was removed and replaced with
  `p2p.seeds`.

- Setting `consensus.tendermint.p2p.unconditional_peer_ids` was renamed to
  `consensus.tendermint.p2p.unconditional_peer`.

General:

- Persistent peers and seed nodes' addresses were generalized to the form
  `pubkey@IP:port` which affected settings `p2p.seeds`,
  `consensus.tendermint.p2p.persistent_peer` and
  `consensus.tendermint.sentry.upstream_address` (until now we used the
  form `ID@IP:port`)

- Similarly, peers are now identified through p2p public keys which affected
  setting `consensus.tendermint.p2p.unconditional_peer` (until now we used
  Tendermint IDs).

Tendermint specific configuration of a seed node stayed the same. The node
can still be tuned through `consensus.tendermint.p2p.*` settings.
