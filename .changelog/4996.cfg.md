go/worker/common/p2p: Refactor P2P package

We are planning to use our P2P network not only for runtime but also for
consensus-related services. Therefore, it makes sense to move the P2P package
up in the hierarchy and rename its configuration flags.

The following configuration changes were made to the p2p config flags:

- Prefix `wroker.` was dropped.

- Flags for the same feature were grouped under the same prefix.

- Flag `worker.client.addresses` was removed.

Below is the list of modified flags that can be used to configure p2p network:

- `p2p.port`

- `p2p.registration.addresses`

- `p2p.gossipsub.peer_outbound_queue_size`

- `p2p.gossipsub.validate_queue_size`

- `p2p.gossipsub.validate_concurrency`

- `p2p.gossipsub.validate_throttle`

- `p2p.connection_manager.max_num_peers`

- `p2p.connection_manager.peer_grace_period`

- `p2p.connection_manager.persistent_peers`

- `p2p.connection_gater.blocked_peers`

- `p2p.peer_manager.connectedness_low_water`
