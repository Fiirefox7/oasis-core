go/p2p: Bootstrap libp2p peers using seed nodes

Seed nodes can now bootstrap libp2p peers. Bootstrapping can be enabled or
disabled using a new configuration setting named
`p2p.discovery.bootstrap.enable`
which can be used on seed nodes as well as non-seed nodes (e.g. clients,
key managers). The latter can also configure how frequently peers are fetched
from the seed nodes with
`p2p.discovery.bootstrap.retention_period`.
