go/oasis-node: Always start libp2p node

Validator nodes are currently not part of our P2P network as it consists
only of nodes that have runtimes configured. Always starting the libp2p
node will make them available for consensus-related services.

As validators now participate in the p2p network, the configuration of
publicly routable p2p addresses through `worker.p2p.addresses` flag is
mandatory in a production setting.
