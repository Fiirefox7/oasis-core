go/runtime: Fix configuring the SGX-based provisioner

Previously there was an edge case when the SGX loader was configured and
remapping to non-SGX was forced (e.g. on client nodes). This would result in
an invalid SGX configuration that resulted in a strange error message about a
missing SIGSTRUCT.

This has now been changed so that remapping happens independent of whether an
SGX loader is configured or not.
