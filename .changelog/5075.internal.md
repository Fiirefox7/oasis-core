runtime/src/enclave_rpc: Add support for insecure key manager RPC requests

The key manager uses encrypted sessions to authenticate clients and protect
sensitive data. The number of sessions is limited, thus susceptible to DoS
attacks. A malicious client can establish multiple sessions in parallel,
preventing other clients from making requests. Furthermore, since each
session is encrypted, the exchanged messages cannot be read or modified.
For public key requests this is not ideal as one would want to cache the
responses locally and serve them to other clients to unburden the manager.
Large quotes also cannot be removed from the exchanged messages if we are
sure that the recipient can obtain them through some other means. Supporting
insecure key manager RPC requests solves some of the before mentioned problems
and leaves space for further optimizations.
